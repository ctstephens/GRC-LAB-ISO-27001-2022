### AUDIT PREP
__________

- ISO 27001:2022 EXCEL SPREADSHEET OR WHICHEVER FRAMEWORK YOU NEED/USE.
Usually you would have to Purchase this from the Offical ISO website but can you find Excel Spreadsheets available online doing a general search.

- IDENTIFY WHO WE NEED TO TALK TO AND WHAT WE NEED TO SEE?
  For this I Mock interviewed the Diector of Information Services & the Chief Information Officer of a University.
- UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ( CONTROLS CAN BE REWRITTENEN/REPHRASED USING USING CHAT GPT AS AN EXAMPLE )
  For this Lab I used Pysical Controls for the Compliance Audit and Risk Assesment.

### AUDIT LOGISTICS
_______________

- WHO DO YOU NEED TO TALK TO? SCHEDULE MEETING? HOW LONG IS NEEDED FOR MEETING?
  This can be done prior with say a liason of the University to save time when you actually perform the Audit.
- REQUESTING SOP'S/POLICIES ETC. ( DOCUMENTATION )

### AUDIT ( ON-SITE OR REMOTELY )
_____________________________

- HIGH IMPACT OF AUDIT; RESPECT TIME GIVEN/PROVIDED FOR AUDIT WITH THE ORGANISATION/PERSONS BEING INTERVIEWED.
